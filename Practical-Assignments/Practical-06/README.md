# Practical Assignment 6: Statistical Hypothesis Testing

This assignment focuses on conducting standard statistical tests on the **Teacher Rating Dataset** to determine relationships between instructor demographics and evaluation scores.

## Objectives
1.  **T-Test:** Analyze if **gender** affects teaching evaluation rates (Comparing means of two groups).
2.  **ANOVA:** Determine if **beauty scores** differ significantly across different **age groups** (Comparing means of >2 groups).
3.  **Chi-Square:** Test for a statistical association between **tenure status** and **gender** (Categorical vs. Categorical).
4.  **Correlation:** Calculate the correlation coefficient to check if **teaching evaluation scores** are correlated with **beauty scores**.

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation.
* **Scipy.stats:** Conducting T-tests, ANOVA (`f_oneway`), Chi-Square (`chi2_contingency`), and Pearson Correlation.
