    "\n",
    "This assignment provided practical application of several fundamental hypothesis tests:\n",
    "* **T-test:** Useful for comparing the means of two independent groups.\n",
    "* **ANOVA:** Effective for comparing the means of three or more independent groups.\n",
    "* **Chi-Square Test:** Essential for testing the independence (or association) between two categorical variables.\n",
    "* **Correlation Test:** Key for quantifying and testing the significance of a linear relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "* **Interpretation:** Understanding the importance of p-values and significance levels ($\\alpha$) in making statistical decisions (rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis).\n",
