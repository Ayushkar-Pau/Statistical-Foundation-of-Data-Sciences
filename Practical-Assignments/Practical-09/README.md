# Practical Assignment 9: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This assignment implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm on the **Iris Dataset** to classify flower species. The process covers the entire machine learning pipeline from data analysis to decision boundary visualization.

## Objectives
1.  **EDA:** Analyzing the dataset structure using statistical summaries and grouping.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Implementing **StandardScaler** to normalize feature magnitudes.
3.  **Modeling:** Training the KNN classifier and evaluating it using Confusion Matrix and Classification Reports.
4.  **Optimization:** Using the **Elbow Method** (plotting Error Rate vs. K) to determine the optimal number of neighbors ($K$).
5.  **Visualization:** Plotting the decision boundaries in 2D space to visualize how the model separates the classes.

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas/Numpy:** Data manipulation.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Plotting error rates and decision boundaries.
* **Scikit-Learn:** KNN Classifier, Standard Scaler, Train-Test Split, and Metrics.
