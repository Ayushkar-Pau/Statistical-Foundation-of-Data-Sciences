# Practical Assignment 10: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This assignment explores the **Wine Dataset** using statistical analysis and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to improve class separability in lower dimensions.

## Objectives
1.  **Statistical Analysis:** Displaying basic statistics (`describe`) and creating boxplots by class.
2.  **Visualization:** Generating scatterplots of raw variables and plotting the **Covariance Matrix** to understand feature relationships.
3.  **Data Scaling:** Standardizing the dataset to handle features with varying scales.
4.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying PCA to reduce the dataset to 2 Principal Components and visualizing the improved separation between wine classes.

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas/Numpy:** Data analysis and covariance calculation.
* **Scikit-Learn:** PCA and StandardScaler.
* **Seaborn/Matplotlib:** Heatmaps and scatterplots.
