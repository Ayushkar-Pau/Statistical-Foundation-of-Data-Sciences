    "This notebook addresses the seventh practical assignment. The focus is on utilizing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models to perform statistical tests equivalent to a t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis using the teacher rating dataset. We will interpret the regression outputs to answer specific questions about the relationships between variables like gender, age, beauty, and evaluation scores."

    "* **`coef` (Coefficient):** This number estimates the average difference in `eval` score between female instructors and the baseline group (male instructors). A negative coefficient suggests females have lower average scores in this sample, while a positive one suggests higher scores.\n",
    "* **`t` (t-statistic):** This value indicates how many standard errors the estimated coefficient is away from zero. A larger absolute value generally suggests a more significant effect.\n",
    "* **`P>|t|` (p-value):** This crucial value tests the null hypothesis that gender has no effect (i.e., the true coefficient is zero). A p-value less than our chosen significance level (typically 0.05) indicates that the observed difference is statistically significant.\n",
    "* **`R-squared`:** This overall model statistic tells us the proportion of the total variation in `eval` scores that is explained by gender. A low R-squared indicates that gender, by itself, explains only a small fraction of why evaluation scores differ.\n",

    "The code cell above calculated these values based on our data and printed a conclusion about statistical significance by comparing the `P>|t|` value to 0.05.\n",

    "## Final Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully addressed all three problems for the seventh practical assignment. The focus was on utilizing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models as a tool to perform analyses equivalent to a t-test, ANOVA, and correlation test on the teacher rating dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Tasks Completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1. Regression with T-test:** An OLS model predicting evaluation scores based on a gender dummy variable was created. The t-statistic and p-value for the dummy variable's coefficient were interpreted to determine if gender significantly affects evaluation rates.\n",
    "* **2. Regression with ANOVA:** An OLS model predicting beauty scores based on categorical age groups was created. An ANOVA table was derived from this model, and the F-statistic and p-value were used to test if mean beauty scores differ significantly across age groups.\n",
    "* **3. Correlation via Regression:** A simple linear regression model predicting evaluation scores based on beauty scores was created. The p-value for the beauty coefficient and the model's R-squared value were interpreted to assess the significance and strength of the linear correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment provided practical experience in using regression analysis as a flexible framework for hypothesis testing:\n",
    "* Understanding how the t-test for a coefficient of a dummy variable in a simple OLS regression is equivalent to an independent samples t-test comparing two group means.\n",
    "* Learning how to generate and interpret an ANOVA table from an OLS regression model with a categorical predictor to test for differences among multiple group means.\n",
    "* Recognizing that the significance test (p-value) for the slope coefficient in a simple linear regression directly tests the significance of the linear correlation between the two variables, while R-squared measures the strength of that association.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes all requirements for the assignment. The solutions have been delivered using the specified regression methods, along with appropriate interpretations of the statistical outputs."
