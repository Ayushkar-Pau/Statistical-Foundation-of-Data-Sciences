## Problems Solved

This analysis addresses five key tasks:

1.  **Duplicate Handling & Comparative Statistics:** Identifying duplicate records based on professor ID and comparing age statistics between the full dataset and a filtered, size-restricted subset.
2.  **Categorical Comparison:** Using a bar chart to compare average teaching evaluations across different course divisions.
3.  **Bivariate Relationship Analysis:** Plotting the relationship between instructor age and evaluation score using a scatter plot with a regression line.
4.  **Gender-Differentiated Plotting:** Enhancing the previous analysis by creating a scatter plot differentiated by gender.
5.  **Multi-Variable Faceted Plot:** Creating a complex scatter plot faceted by both gender and tenure to analyze their combined influence.
