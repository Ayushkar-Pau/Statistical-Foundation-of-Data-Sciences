    "This notebook addresses the fifth practical assignment, focusing on two key areas of statistics. First, we will calculate empirical probabilities from the \"Teacher Rating Dataset\" to determine the likelihood of receiving certain evaluation scores. Second, we will formally state the null and alternative hypotheses for a two-tailed test comparing the performance of professional and regional basketball players."

    "\n",
    "* **1. Probability (Single Condition):** We calculated the empirical probability of a teacher receiving an evaluation score greater than 4.5 by filtering the dataset for favorable outcomes and dividing by the total number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2. Probability (Compound Condition):** We extended the probability calculation to a specific range, finding the likelihood of an evaluation score being greater than 3.5 *and* less than 4.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3. Hypothesis Testing:** For a given scenario comparing two basketball teams, we formally stated the **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)** and the **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)** for a two-tailed test, framing the problem for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment provided a solid foundation in two critical areas of statistics:\n",
    "* **Empirical Probability:** Understanding how to calculate the real-world probability of an event by analyzing a sample dataset.\n",
    "* **Hypothesis Framing:** Learning the crucial first step of any statistical test, which is to correctly define the null hypothesis (the statement of no difference) and the alternative hypothesis (the claim to be tested).\n",
