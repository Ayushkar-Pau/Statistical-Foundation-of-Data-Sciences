Used the same dataset used in Practical 2:

Question 1. Identify all duplicate cases using prof. Using all observations, find the average and standard deviation for age. Repeat the analysis by first filtering the data set to include one observation for each instructor with a total number of observations restricted to 94.

Question 2. Using a bar chart, demonstrate if instructors teaching lower-division courses receive higher average teaching evaluations.

Question 3. Plot the relationship between age and teaching evaluation scores.

Question 4. Using gender-differentiated scatter plots, plot the relationship between age and teaching evaluation scores.

Question 5. Create a scatterplot of age and evaluation scores, differentiated by gender and tenure.
