# Practical Assignment 4: Data Visualization & Analysis (Student Ratings)

This assignment involves analyzing the **Student Rating Dataset** to uncover insights regarding professor demographics, tenure status, and evaluation scores using statistical calculations and data visualization.

## Objectives

1.  **Demographic Analysis:** Calculating the percentage of visible minorities who are tenured professors and assessing if tenure status differs based on minority status.
2.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Computing the mean and standard deviation of age for both tenured and untenured professors to see if average age differs.
3.  **Visualization Choice:** Determining the most appropriate graph (Histogram/Distribution Plot) for the 'age' variable and plotting it.
4.  **Bar Chart Comparison:** Defining the difference between `pyplot.bar` (vertical) and `pyplot.barh` (horizontal) and plotting the gender distribution.
5.  **Median Analysis:** Calculating the median evaluation score specifically for tenured professors.

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas:** Data filtering, grouping, and statistical calculations (mean, std, median).
* **Matplotlib:** Creating bar charts (`bar`, `barh`) and distribution plots.
* **Seaborn:** Enhancing visualizations for age distribution.
